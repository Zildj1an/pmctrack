/*
 * heap.cpp
 *
 * This is the implementation file with the c++ code for the operations for this ADT.
 * The heap is implemented with an array, following this:
 * 	For a node i, an array P:
 *	• left child is P[2i]
 *	• right child at P[2i + 1]
 *	• parent is P[i/2]
 * AND
 *  heap-propery is committed:
 * 		for every node i:
 * 			P[i] <= P[2i]
 * 			P[i] <= P[2i+1]
 *
 * Version 1.1 :
 * 		->Made class template to contain any data type.
 * Version 1.2 :
 * Some possible improvements from the Classes & Data structures in c++ book:
 * 		->No swaps needed since we can compare the elements before to find the right place in the heap.
 * 		->Constructor of a heap with n elements from an array (no heap) in O(n)
 * 		->Some extra performance improvements.
 * Version 1.3 :
 * 		->Added funcion min, which returns top of heap
 * 		->Added security/sturdiness to the ADT making some extra checks
 * 		->Added change_key procedure: including decrease and increase keys
