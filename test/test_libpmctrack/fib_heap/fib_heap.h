/*
 * fib_heap.h
 *
 * This is the header (declarations) file for a personal implementation of fibonacci minheaps.
 *
 *  A fibonacci heap is a set of heaps, not in order, which tries to get best
 * amortized cost.
 *
 * This header file contains declarations, documentation & costs for the operations of this ADT.
